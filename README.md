# Next.js 15 Production Build Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a rendering issue encountered in a Next.js 15 application during production builds.  A simple component fails to render in production, resulting in a blank page. This bug is only reproducible in the production build and not in the development environment.  The solution provided addresses this issue.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to create a production build.
4. Run `npm run start` to start the production server.
5. Observe that the application renders a blank page instead of the expected content.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring proper configuration and handling of the application's rendering process within the Next.js framework, as detailed in the `index.solution.js` file.
